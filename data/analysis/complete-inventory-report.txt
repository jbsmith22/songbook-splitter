=== POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS ===
1. Source books were renamed or removed after processing
2. Collection books (Various Artists, Broadway, Movie/TV) create multiple output folders
3. Books were processed from a different source location
4. Duplicate processing runs created extra folders

=== NEXT STEPS ===
1. Review the 31 unprocessed source books - do they need processing?
2. Investigate the 278 unmatched processed folders - are they valid or duplicates?
3. Verify collection books (Various Artists, Broadway, Movie/TV) are properly accounted for
