AUTO-POLLING SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================

To enable automatic status updates when reprocessing finishes:

1. Open: web/viewers/complete_provenance_viewer.html

2. Find the line near the end that says:
   </script>
   </body>
   </html>

3. Right BEFORE </body>, add this line:
   <script src="auto_polling.js"></script>

   So it looks like:
   </script>
   <script src="auto_polling.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>

4. Save the file

5. Refresh the viewer in your browser

WHAT IT DOES:
- When you click "Reprocess", it tracks the job
- Polls DynamoDB status every 30 seconds
- Shows "PROCESSING... ⏳" in the status column
- Highlights the row in orange
- Shows notification when complete
- Updates the status display to show "X processing (polling every 30s)"

NOTIFICATIONS:
